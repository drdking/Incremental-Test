For main page:

Main Wrapper/box for the game
Should include:
    Main area with buttons (sub menu for scene switching)
    Notification area
    ... others?
Menu area  
    Top, or bottom or side?


Examples: 
A Dark Room:
from html file
    Body: - broken into
        Wrapper:
            SaveNotify - blips Saved in upper right
            content - Main Game window in middle
                outerSlider
                    main (seems to be the same as outerSlider)
                        header - has selectors for different areas


Interestingly when it runs more are added on initial load...
    W/in Wrapper:
            Notifications - notification area on left

                    w/in Main:
                        locationSlider

Location slider gets things added to it as needed looks like:
    Room Panel - main area for room?
        Store container - items, doesn't show up until wood is unlock


On interesting.. when switching areas looks like they just litterally slide the different areas from one side to another, not actually change "scenes", one is just hidden to the side...

Also the stores container seems to be anchored, and does not move so it's always visiable regardless of the underlying rooms
-- It has a seperate village box... that holds supplies for the village...




    Menu: - bottom right
*Interesntinely the menu is not part of the initial index.html page...
** Find where it's added: ___


Also fun: not using button class... difines everything as just <div>

Come back to this later...

Kittens Game:
seems to define it's areas much more locally in the file and not hidden

Header: a bunch of shit... w/ scripts and other stuff
    ** come back to this

Body:
    gamePageConter (main continer?)
        topbar: The top bar...
            Bunch of small <span>s for the title, MOD and menu..
            looks like <divs> broken in to <spans>
            the html and the actual running page are set up a bit differently.. probably gets changed in code
        loadingContainer: ????
        game: 
            tooltip
            leftColumn
                leftcolumviewport "loading"
            midColumn
                midcolumnviewport "loading"
                gameContainerHelp -- looks like just a placehoder if nothing is loaded overtop of it, has links to discord and whatnot
            rightColumn
                Calendar
                Right-tab-header
                    Has Log and Queue buttons
                ObserveButton: for observing astrominic events...
                right-tab (id"log")
                    the log,
                    clear buttonsfilters
                    the log itself
                right-tab (id"queue") 
                    has viewport inside it
            toggle center ???

        then a bunch of others:
            These are all the middle options windows... look hidden but pop up when the button pressed but seem to always be there in the background
        creditsDiv
        optionsDiv
        exportDiv
        importDiv
        appDiv

        footerlinks: Bottom menu

So looks like in kittens game, it does completely change the <div> in the middle Panel
So when you click on village the actual <div> completely changes to <div class ="tabInner Village"> and when it's on bonfire its <div class="tabInner Bonfire">
so something is changing completely


Cookie Clicker:
Body   
    Wrapper
        TopBar: blah blah
        Game:
            Versionnumber (bottom left)




*** Look up <div> id= vs class=
